<h2> Letter to future Jeremiah </h2>
<p> Dear future Jeremiah, I want you to continue to have the motivation and passion for basketball that you have today. I know that you are going to hesitate about things because you just had an injury but continue to work hard. Also I want you to stay on top of school. Last thing, continue to grow as the person you are today.</p>
